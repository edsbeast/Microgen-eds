Each folder includes .stl files of the different surfaces at a constant resolution value of 15 in microgen and varying offset values, listed in the name of each file.

The surface-functions file has been updated to include the combined surfaces: Schwarz P + Diamond + F-RD as "SDFRD" and Schwarz P + Split-P + IWP as "SSPIWP". 

The files "microgen[surface name].py" are the python files used to generate the stl files in each of the folders.

There's one .mphbin file in the "Gyroids" folder, generated from COMSOL
